\chapter{Design Decisions} \label{chap:design}

Every now and then a programmer is faced with the question ``Why have you implemented it that way?''.
This is then the chance to outline the various pros and cons of different approaches and assign appropriate weights such that the approach taken turns out to be the best.
In this chapter the various design considerations are presented and the reasons why the library is the way it is are given.
